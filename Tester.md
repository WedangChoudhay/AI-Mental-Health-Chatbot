- Usability Testing
- Load and Stress Testing
- Security Testing
- Accessibility Testing

### Tools Used:
- Selenium, Cypress
- Postman
- JIRA for bug tracking
- TestRail or Google Sheets for test case documentation

### Example Test Case:

| Test ID | Description              | Input           | Expected Output                                       | Status |
